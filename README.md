# Flutter-Weather

Used the api "https://openweathermap.org/api" to create an app through Flutter that works for both Android and IOS. Main code is provided but not everything is here. 
App contains a front page that asks for user input on the city they'd like to check on. After entering a valid city and pressing search, a loading page is provided.
The final page is a 7 day forecast with images that best suit each day. Under the settings page, there is also an option to change the degree of the user's choosing.
